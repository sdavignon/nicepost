I saw this post and want to replicate this, but I need to set up an upvote bot that does the following.  
I need to upvote the **main post**, of which it has a **comment** with a specific tag #exampletag in the comment body. (NOT the tag in the main post or the main post body, should work like @originalworks except the trigger is #exampletag instead of @originalworks or !originalworks) The comment should not be made by the original author and the commenter has to have a rep of over 30.  
And then my account has to comment **that comment with the tag**, saying that I upvoted the main post. After that, my account has to resteem the main post. How should I do this in steem-python? The upvote and comment should only be done once per main post, working exactly like @originalworks except for the trigger and some constraints.

Also, with the same conditions, what should I do to do the same thing when mentioned as @myuser instead of #exampletag, exactly what @originalworks does except that there is no !originalworks?  
Please give a guide.  
Thank you very much.
